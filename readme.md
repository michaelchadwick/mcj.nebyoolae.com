# [Man Cave Jam](https://mcj.nebyoolae.com)

Some friends of mine and I get together occasionally to jam on skins, bow-chicka-bow-bow, and guitbox. Sometimes, other guitboxes, a plinker, and assorted vocalizers join in. Regardless of the combination, long, drawn-out stuff gets played and recorded, and this is the web application for that, replete with media players for listening.

Tech used:

* Andy Taylor's [1140px CSS Grid](http://cssgrid.net) layout, which has now been retired, but the code still works!
* [jPlayer](https://jplayer.org) for media streaming
* [Google Fonts](https://google.com/fonts) for the Sigma One section headers
